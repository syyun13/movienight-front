# Movie Night üçø


**Final Project by Stella (Ser Yoon) Yun**


Movie Night is an event management website where you can search for a movie, choose the one that you want to watch, create an event and invite other users to the event.


Frontend was built with React.js and backend was built with AWS RDS, Lambda, and API Gateway as well as IMDb API.


This Github repo is linked to AWS CodePipeline so that it automatically deploys on S3 bucket when a new commit is pushed to the master branch.
